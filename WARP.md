# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

The Unique School System is an educational management platform. This repository is currently initialized but does not yet contain source code.

## Development Setup

*To be updated when project structure is established*

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm/pnpm (if using JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Python 3.x and pip (if using Python)
- Go (if using Go)
- Docker (if containerized)

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Unique-School-System

# Install dependencies (update based on actual tech stack)
# npm install
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# go mod tidy
```

## Common Development Commands

*These will be updated once the project structure is established*

### Build Commands
```bash
# Add build commands here once build system is chosen
# npm run build
# make build
# go build
```

### Testing
```bash
# Add test commands here
# npm test
# python -m pytest
# go test ./...
```

### Linting and Formatting

```

## Architecture

*To be documented once the codebase structure is established*

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: *TBD*
- Backend: *TBD* 
- Database: *TBD*
- Authentication: *TBD*

### Key Components
*Will be documented as the system is built*

## Environment Configuration
*Add environment variable documentation here*

## Deployment
*Add deployment instructions once deployment strategy is determined*
